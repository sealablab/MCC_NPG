As you can see from [[FaultyCat-Pinout-sketch|the diagram]], there are only 5 unique pins to drive .

## GND
Self-explanatory
## 3v3
Relative to [[02-FaultyCat-Electrical#GND|GND]]

## HVPWM
PWM (IN)

## HVPULSE
HVPULSE (IN)

## HV Isolation

Faulty cat Â floats the high-voltage side, which means there is no electrical path between the EMFI probe output and the input voltage ground.
